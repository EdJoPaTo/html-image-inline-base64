# HTML Inline

> Reads an html file and inlines all the images with base64

This allows for html files which are self contained.
For whatever reason no Markdown to HTML tool seems to be be able to do so.

Replaces

```html
<img src="media/image.png">
```

into

```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0Kâ€¦">
```
